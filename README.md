# releasepost

*Repost changelogs to your static site generator git repository*

releasepost relies on a configuration file to identify what release to monitor and where to repost it.


It can generate json, markdown, and asciidoctor files.

## Core

TODO

### Configuration

TODO


The following example is used for a HUGO website

**Command**
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<insert read-only token>
releasepost --config .releaserepost.yaml
```

**Configuration**

.releaserepost.yaml
```
changelogs:
  - kind: github
    dir: content/en/docs/changelogs/updatecli
    formats:
      - extension: asciidoc
        indexfilename: _index
      - extension: json
        indexfilename: _index
    spec:
      owner: updatecli
      repository: udash
```

## Plugins

### GitHub

#### Credentials

GitHub integration requires a read-only personal access token.
The token must have enough permission to read release information.

#### Configuration

```
changelogs:
  - kind: github
    spec:
      # Define the GitHub owner
      owner: updatecli
      # Define the GitHub repository
      repository: updatecli
      # Define the release type to retrieve
      typefilter:
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
        release: true
        latest: true
      # Define the GitHub url
      url: https://github.com
      # Define the username used to authenticate
      username: john
      # Define the token used to authenticate
      token: xxx
```

The following environment variables will be used as a fallback

* `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` used to set owner and repository
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` used to set the token
* `GITHUB_URL` used to set the GitHub url
* `GITHUB_ACTOR` used to set the GitHub username

## Integration

### Updatecli

Releasepost is designed to work with [Updatecli](https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli) where releasepost is responsible to generate the correct files based on third changelogs and Updatecli to automate the process of publishing them to a git repository

## FAQ

**Can releasepost generate changelog?**

No, they are already great tools for doing that.

* [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) can automatically generate the next changelogs based on pullrequest labels. If the generated changelog is wrong, you can still update labels on already merged pullrequest and then retrigger release drafter to update the the generated changelog.

* [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) can automatically generate the next changelogs based on commit following conventional commit. If the generated changelog is wrong, you can still modify your git history...

* [ Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie) is another great tool to generate changelog

The purpose of releasepost is to retrieve already published changelogs and to republish them, for example on a project website.


**Why using _index instead of index on HUGO project?**

[The difference between `index.md` and `_index.md`](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)
